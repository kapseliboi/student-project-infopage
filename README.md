# Student project home page

Super simple TypeScript + React application. If you only want to modify some text, just edit pageTexts.json in src/assets.

## Deployment

Just add the deployment repository as new remote called "deployment". This can be done like this:

`git remote add deployment https://github.com/kapseliboi/Kansiareena-student-project`

Then run:

`npm run build`

`npm run deploy`
